      <description>I was sent to Barcelona last October 2015 to attend the Smashing Conference. It was a great fun experience! Although it was my fifth visit, there are always new things and places to discover in Barcelona.
The conference venue was the magnificent Palau de la Música Catalana. The grandoise ceiling (shown above), stained-glass works and all the details are just splendid.
