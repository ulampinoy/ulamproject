      <description>Brunch is a combination of breakfast and lunch. The term is a portmanteau of breakfast and lunch. Often, it is a heavy meal meant to take the place of both breakfast and lunch.
A meal is not usually considered brunch if it is started before 10 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning, such meals would still be considered breakfast. Typically brunch is had at around 10AM, close to lunch time but still before.</description>
