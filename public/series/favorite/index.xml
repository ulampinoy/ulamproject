      <description>Milkfish or bangus is cooked in tamarind-based broth with onions, ginger, tomatoes, green chilis and pechay. Sinigang na Bangus is very popular because milkfish is the most common farmed fish in the Philippines. But not all bangus are equal! The most sought after is Dagupan Bangus in the province of Pangasinan.
 One whole tomato   Whether you are using the real sampaloc or the instant powder version, adding tomato to your sinigang upscale the broth.</description>

      <description>Spicy and sour are the flavors that could compliment any dish and enhance your appetite. Kimchi is both, spicy and sour.
It&amp;rsquo;s not easy to find a good kimchi here in Madrid. The bottled kimchi available at the Chinese store taste sweet! Really? Sweet kimchi? No thanks!
We found a proper Korean store in the Mercado de Maravillas in Cuatro Caminos. The shopkeeper is a Korean lady making her own kimchi.</description>

      <description>Here’s one of my all-time fave dish – Huevos Rotos which literally means “Broken Eggs.” It is not the typical scrambled eggs where you beat the egg whites &amp;amp; yolks together before you cook it.
Typically here in Madrid, the eggs are broken, literally when they serve it, in front of you!
 A dozen eggs on tray   Ingredients  2 Eggs Chorizo Iberico de Bellota (or any chorizo of your choosing) Asparagus (or any greens you like) Onions Garlics Olive oil Salt &amp;amp; Pepper Paprika &amp;amp; Parsley (for garnish)  Procedure  Sauté onion &amp;amp; garlic in olive oil Throw in the chorizo; let it sizzle until it change the color of the oil Add in the asparagus; sweat it and turn off stove Season with salt &amp;amp; pepper Now this is the part we “break” the eggs.</description>
