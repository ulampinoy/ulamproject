### Procedure

A wok is ideal for stir-frying but the regular pan will do but make sure it is smoky hot when you start. In rapid succession, all must go but here is the sequence:

1. First, in olive oil, the garlic & the beef strips, season right away with salt, pepper & cayenne.
2. Throw in all the veggies, onions, bell pepper, broccoli.
3. Add the soy sauce and drizzle with a little sesame oli

Super important: **Do not overcook.**
Serve with steamed rice or noodles.

Fire up your day. Fire up the wok. Happy cooking & eating!
