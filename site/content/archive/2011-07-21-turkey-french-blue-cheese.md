---

I used to tell myself that chicken breast and white onion are the good stuff. I would shop for it and make dishes out of it without even thinking about it. Until last weekend, I saw some turkey breast and remembered that I have red onions literally hanging around the kitchen. I realized that there are more textures and flavors from things we are not used to. Here is my proof.

### Ingredients

* Turkey breasts filets
* Red onions
* _Bleu d'Auvergne_ or commonly known as French blue cheese
* Light cream
* Extra virgin olive oil
* Salt & pepper
* _Hierbas provenzales_ (albahaca, orégano, romero, tomillo, ajedrea & mejorana)
* Green asparagus
* Parsley (for garnish)

Bleu d'Auvergne is a French blue cheese which is less salted, with a creamier and more buttery taste and a moister texture.

### Procedure

1. Rub the turkey breast with the herbs, salt & pepper
2. On medium heat put the skillet pan with a little olive oil
3. Pan-grill the turkey breast. I usually cook the first side down more for a crusty texture and turn the other side just to cook it briefly. This gives you more textures on the meat. When the breast are done, set aside on a plate
4. Pan-grill the green asparagus and then set aside.
5. Add a little more olive oil and caramelize the red onions by slow cooking it on low heat. If you sauté it real fast you will end up with crunchy and stronger flavor. In this recipe we want the red onions to caramelize slowly so it becomes soft and sweet. Set this aside.
6. Pour the light cream and blue cheese in the pan on low heat and mix it until the blue cheese melts
7. Add the caramelized red onion in the blue cheese sauce. Stir in for a minute.
8. Serve the turkey breast, asparagus and the caramelized red onions in blue cheese sauce. Garnish with parsley and extra virgin olive oil

Enjoy cooking & _bon appétit!_
