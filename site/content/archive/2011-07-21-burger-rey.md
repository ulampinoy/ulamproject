Last night while watching [No Reservations Techniques episode](http://www.travelchannel.com/TV_Shows/Anthony_Bourdain/Photos/Slideshow_Techniques_Journal?fbid=null), I told myself that I should make my own burger patty. Earlier today I've made my first attempt:

Not that bad I think. Here is the view from the back:

Though I enjoyed it very much, there are still things that can be done to improve it. I will post the recipe in the next attempt. Stay tuned!
