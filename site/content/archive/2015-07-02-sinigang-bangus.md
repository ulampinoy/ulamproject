Milkfish or _bangus_ is cooked in tamarind-based broth with onions, ginger, tomatoes, green chilis and pechay. _Sinigang na Bangus_ is very popular because milkfish is the most common farmed fish in the Philippines. But not all _bangus_ are equal! The most sought after is *Dagupan Bangus* in the province of Pangasinan.

Whether you are using the real *sampaloc* or the instant powder version, adding tomato to your *sinigang* upscale the broth. Make sure to put the ripest fruit you can find!
