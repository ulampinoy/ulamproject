Bulacan is a big province known for its rich culture and history. It has 21 municipalities and 569 barangays. Located 11km north of Manila, it is also one of the countryâ€™s oldest provinces.

Bulacan was originally founded in 1578, seven years after the defeat of the native Macabebe and Hagonoy clans in the Battle of Bangkusay. Official records say Bulacan was established on March 10, 1917, during the American period.

Bordered by Pampanga to the west, Quezon and Aurora to the east, and Manila and Rizal to the south, Bulacan is a melting pot of Filipino cuisine and culture.
